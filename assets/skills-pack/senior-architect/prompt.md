## Decision Workflows

### Database Selection Workflow

Use when choosing a database for a new project or migrating existing data.

**Step 1: Identify data characteristics**
| Characteristic | Points to SQL | Points to NoSQL |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Structured with relationships | ✓ | |
| ACID transactions required | ✓ | |
| Flexible/evolving schema | | ✓ |
| Document-oriented data | | ✓ |
| Time-series data | | ✓ (specialized) |

**Step 2: Evaluate scale requirements**
- <1M records, single region → PostgreSQL or MySQL
- 1M-100M records, read-heavy → PostgreSQL with read replicas
- >100M records, global distribution → CockroachDB, Spanner, or DynamoDB
- High write throughput (>10K/sec) → Cassandra or ScyllaDB

**Step 3: Check consistency requirements**
- Strong consistency required → SQL or CockroachDB
- Eventual consistency acceptable → DynamoDB, Cassandra, MongoDB

**Step 4: Document decision**
Create an ADR (Architecture Decision Record) with:
- Context and requirements
- Options considered
- Decision and rationale
- Trade-offs accepted

**Quick reference:**
```
PostgreSQL → Default choice for most applications
MongoDB    → Document store, flexible schema
Redis      → Caching, sessions, real-time features
DynamoDB   → Serverless, auto-scaling, AWS-native
TimescaleDB → Time-series data with SQL interface

### Architecture Pattern Selection Workflow

Use when designing a new system or refactoring existing architecture.

**Step 1: Assess team and project size**
| Team Size | Recommended Starting Point |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| 1-3 developers | Modular monolith |
| 4-10 developers | Modular monolith or service-oriented |
| 10+ developers | Consider microservices |

**Step 2: Evaluate deployment requirements**
- Single deployment unit acceptable → Monolith
- Independent scaling needed → Microservices
- Mixed (some services scale differently) → Hybrid

**Step 3: Consider data boundaries**
- Shared database acceptable → Monolith or modular monolith
- Strict data isolation required → Microservices with separate DBs
- Event-driven communication fits → Event-sourcing/CQRS

**Step 4: Match pattern to requirements**

| Requirement | Recommended Pattern |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Rapid MVP development | Modular Monolith |
| Independent team deployment | Microservices |
| Complex domain logic | Domain-Driven Design |
| High read/write ratio difference | CQRS |
| Audit trail required | Event Sourcing |
| Third-party integrations | Hexagonal/Ports & Adapters |

### Monolith vs Microservices Decision

**Choose Monolith when:**
- [ ] Team is small (<10 developers)
- [ ] Domain boundaries are unclear
- [ ] Rapid iteration is priority
- [ ] Operational complexity must be minimized
- [ ] Shared database is acceptable

**Choose Microservices when:**
- [ ] Teams can own services end-to-end
- [ ] Independent deployment is critical
- [ ] Different scaling requirements per component
- [ ] Technology diversity is needed
- [ ] Domain boundaries are well understood

**Hybrid approach:**
Start with a modular monolith. Extract services only when:
1. A module has significantly different scaling needs
2. A team needs independent deployment
3. Technology constraints require separation
