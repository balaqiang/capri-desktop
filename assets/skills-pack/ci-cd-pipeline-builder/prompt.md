# CI/CD Pipeline Builder

**Tier:** POWERFUL  
**Category:** Engineering  
**Domain:** DevOps / Automation

## Overview

Use this skill to generate pragmatic CI/CD pipelines from detected project stack signals, not guesswork. It focuses on fast baseline generation, repeatable checks, and environment-aware deployment stages.

## Core Capabilities

- Detect language/runtime/tooling from repository files
- Recommend CI stages (`lint`, `test`, `build`, `deploy`)
- Generate GitHub Actions or GitLab CI starter pipelines
- Include caching and matrix strategy based on detected stack
- Emit machine-readable detection output for automation
- Keep pipeline logic aligned with project lockfiles and build commands

## When to Use

- Bootstrapping CI for a new repository
- Replacing brittle copied pipeline files
- Migrating between GitHub Actions and GitLab CI
- Auditing whether pipeline steps match actual stack
- Creating a reproducible baseline before custom hardening

## Key Workflows

### 1. Detect Stack

Supports input via stdin or `--input` file for offline analysis payloads.

### 2. Generate Pipeline From Detection

Or end-to-end from repo directly:

### 3. Validate Before Merge

1. Confirm commands exist in project (`test`, `lint`, `build`).
2. Run generated pipeline locally where possible.
3. Ensure required secrets/env vars are documented.
4. Keep deploy jobs gated by protected branches/environments.

### 4. Add Deployment Stages Safely

- Start with CI-only (`lint/test/build`).
- Add staging deploy with explicit environment context.
- Add production deploy with manual gate/approval.
- Keep rollout/rollback commands explicit and auditable.
