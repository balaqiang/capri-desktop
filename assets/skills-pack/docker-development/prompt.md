YOU ARE USING THE SKILL "docker-development" FOR THIS ANSWER. It was written for someone with more tools than you: here you cannot run scripts or open files, so give the advice and the result yourself, in your own voice, and only as long as the job needs.

# Docker Development

> Smaller images. Faster builds. Secure containers. No guesswork.

Opinionated Docker workflow that turns bloated Dockerfiles into production-grade containers. Covers optimization, multi-stage builds, compose orchestration, and security hardening.

Not a Docker tutorial — a set of concrete decisions about how to build containers that don't waste time, space, or attack surface.

## Slash Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/docker-development optimize` | Analyze and optimize a Dockerfile for size, speed, and layer caching |
| `/docker-development compose` | Generate or improve docker-compose.yml with best practices |
| `/docker-development security` | Audit a Dockerfile or running container for security issues |

---

## When This Skill Activates

Recognize these patterns from the user:

- "Optimize this Dockerfile"
- "My Docker build is slow"
- "Create a docker-compose for this project"
- "Is this Dockerfile secure?"
- "Reduce my Docker image size"
- "Set up multi-stage builds"
- "Docker best practices for [language/framework]"
- Any request involving: Dockerfile, docker-compose, container, image size, build cache, Docker security

If the user has a Dockerfile or wants to containerize something → this skill applies.

## Workflow

### `/docker-development optimize` — Dockerfile Optimization

1. **Analyze current state**
   - Read the Dockerfile
   - Identify base image and its size
   - Count layers (each RUN/COPY/ADD = 1 layer)
   - Check for common anti-patterns

2. **Apply optimization checklist**

   ```
   BASE IMAGE
   ├── Use specific tags, never :latest in production
   ├── Prefer slim/alpine variants (debian-slim > ubuntu > debian)
   ├── Pin digest for reproducibility in CI: image@sha256:...
   └── Match base to runtime needs (don't use python:3.12 for a compiled binary)

   LAYER OPTIMIZATION
   ├── Combine related RUN commands with && \
   ├── Order layers: least-changing first (deps before source code)
   ├── Clean package manager cache in the same RUN layer
   ├── Use .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files
   └── Separate build deps from runtime deps

   BUILD CACHE
   ├── COPY dependency files before source code (package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod)
   ├── Install deps in a separate layer from code copy
   ├── Use BuildKit cache mounts: --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache
   └── Avoid COPY . . before dependency installation

   MULTI-STAGE BUILDS
   ├── Stage 1: build (full SDK, build tools, dev deps)
   ├── Stage 2: runtime (minimal base, only production artifacts)
   ├── COPY --from=builder only what's needed
   └── Final image should have NO build tools, NO source code, NO dev deps

3. **Generate optimized Dockerfile**
   - Apply all relevant optimizations
   - Add inline comments explaining each decision
   - Report estimated size reduction

4. **Validate**

### `/docker-development compose` — Docker Compose Configuration

1. **Identify services**
   - Application (web, API, worker)
   - Database (postgres, mysql, redis, mongo)
   - Cache (redis, memcached)
   - Queue (rabbitmq, kafka)
   - Reverse proxy (nginx, traefik, caddy)

2. **Apply compose best practices**

   ```
   SERVICES
   ├── Use depends_on with condition: service_healthy
   ├── Add healthchecks for every service
   ├── Set resource limits (mem_limit, cpus)
   ├── Use named volumes for persistent data
   └── Pin image versions

   NETWORKING
   ├── Create explicit networks (don't rely on default)
   ├── Separate frontend and backend networks
   ├── Only expose ports that need external access
   └── Use internal: true for backend-only networks

   ENVIRONMENT
   ├── Use env_file for secrets, not inline environment
   ├── Never commit .env files (add to .gitignore)
   ├── Use variable substitution: ${VAR:-default}
   └── Document all required env vars

   DEVELOPMENT vs PRODUCTION
   ├── Use compose profiles or override files
   ├── Dev: bind mounts for hot reload, debug ports exposed
   ├── Prod: named volumes, no debug ports, restart: unless-stopped
   └── docker-compose.override.yml for dev-only config

3. **Generate compose file**
   - Output docker-compose.yml with healthchecks, networks, volumes
   - Generate .env.example with all required variables documented
   - Add dev/prod profile annotations

### `/docker-development security` — Container Security Audit

1. **Dockerfile audit**

   | Check | Severity | Fix |
   |-------|----------|-----|
   | Running as root | Critical | Add `USER nonroot` after creating user |
   | Using :latest tag | High | Pin to specific version |
   | Secrets in ENV/ARG | Critical | Use BuildKit secrets: `--mount=type=secret` |
   | COPY with broad glob | Medium | Use specific paths, add .dockerignore |
   | Unnecessary EXPOSE | Low | Only expose ports the app uses |
   | No HEALTHCHECK | Medium | Add HEALTHCHECK with appropriate interval |
   | Privileged instructions | High | Avoid `--privileged`, drop capabilities |
   | Package manager cache retained | Low | Clean in same RUN layer |

2. **Runtime security checks**
