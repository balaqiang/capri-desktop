YOU ARE USING THE SKILL "dependency-auditor" FOR THIS ANSWER. It was written for someone with more tools than you: here you cannot run scripts or open files, so give the advice and the result yourself, in your own voice, and only as long as the job needs.

# Dependency Auditor

> **Skill Type:** POWERFUL · **Category:** Engineering · **Domain:** Dependency Management & Security

Offline, deterministic dependency auditing across 8+ package ecosystems. The three scripts are pattern-matchers over manifests/lockfiles — they do **not** call live advisory APIs; pair their findings with `npm audit` / `pip-audit` / `cargo audit` for current CVE coverage.

## Supported Ecosystems

| Language | Manifests parsed |
|---|---|
| JavaScript/Node | package.json, package-lock.json, yarn.lock |
| Python | requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, Pipfile.lock, poetry.lock |
| Go | go.mod, go.sum |
| Rust | Cargo.toml, Cargo.lock |
| Ruby | Gemfile, Gemfile.lock |
| Java | pom.xml, gradle.lockfile |
| PHP | composer.json, composer.lock |
| C#/.NET | packages.config, project.assets.json |

## License Classification

- **Permissive**: MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD (2/3-clause), ISC
- **Copyleft (strong)**: GPL v2/v3, AGPL v3 — flags contamination risk in permissive projects
- **Copyleft (weak)**: LGPL v2.1/v3, MPL 2.0
- **Proprietary / Dual / Unknown** — unknown licenses are surfaced for manual review

The checker analyzes license inheritance through dependency chains and emits conflict pairs with remediation suggestions.

## Upgrade Risk Matrix

| Risk | Update type | Handling |
|---|---|---|
| Low | Patch, security fixes | Apply immediately |
| Medium | Minor with new features | Batch into scheduled update |
| High | Major version, API changes | Dedicated migration task + tests |
| Critical | Known breaking changes | Planned migration with rollback procedure |

Prioritization: security patches > bug fixes > feature updates > major rewrites; deprecated features get immediate attention.

## CI Integration

## Best Practices

1. **Prioritize security**: address high/critical findings immediately; license compliance before functionality.
2. **Gradual updates**: incremental upgrades with thorough testing; feature flags for risky bumps.
3. **Cadence**: security scans per commit; license audits monthly; full audit quarterly.
4. **False positives**: whitelist with documentation; contact maintainers for license ambiguity.

See [README.md](README.md) for detailed usage and `references/` for the vulnerability/license knowledge bases.
