# Incident Commander Skill

**Category:** Engineering Team  
**Tier:** POWERFUL  
**Author:** Claude Skills Team  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Last Updated:** February 2026

## Overview

Incident response framework for **availability/reliability incidents** (outages, degradations, failed deploys): severity classification, timeline reconstruction, and post-incident review.

**This is NOT security incident triage.** For security events (ransomware, intrusion, data exfiltration, IOC analysis, NIST SP 800-61 forensics), route to `incident-response`. Both skills use SEV1-SEV4 labels; this one scores operational impact (users, revenue, SLA), while `incident-response` classifies attack types and forensic handling.

## Key Features

- **Automated Severity Classification** - Intelligent incident triage based on impact and urgency metrics
- **Timeline Reconstruction** - Transform scattered logs and events into coherent incident narratives
- **Post-Incident Review Generation** - Structured PIRs with multiple RCA frameworks
- **Communication Templates** - Pre-built templates for stakeholder updates and escalations
- **Runbook Integration** - Generate actionable runbooks from incident patterns

## Skills Included

### Core Tools

1. **Incident Classifier** (`incident_classifier.py`)
   - Analyzes incident descriptions and outputs severity levels
   - Recommends response teams and initial actions
   - Generates communication templates based on severity

2. **Timeline Reconstructor** (`timeline_reconstructor.py`)
   - Processes timestamped events from multiple sources
   - Reconstructs chronological incident timeline
   - Identifies gaps and provides duration analysis

3. **PIR Generator** (`pir_generator.py`)
   - Creates comprehensive Post-Incident Review documents
   - Applies multiple RCA frameworks (5 Whys, Fishbone, Timeline)
   - Generates actionable follow-up items

## Incident Response Framework

### Severity Classification System

#### SEV1 - Critical Outage
**Definition:** Complete service failure affecting all users or critical business functions

**Characteristics:**
- Customer-facing services completely unavailable
- Data loss or corruption affecting users
- Security breaches with customer data exposure
- Revenue-generating systems down
- SLA violations with financial penalties

**Response Requirements:**
- Immediate escalation to on-call engineer
- Incident Commander assigned within 5 minutes
- Executive notification within 15 minutes
- Public status page update within 15 minutes
- War room established
- All hands on deck if needed

**Communication Frequency:** Every 15 minutes until resolution

#### SEV2 - Major Impact
**Definition:** Significant degradation affecting subset of users or non-critical functions

**Characteristics:**
- Partial service degradation (>25% of users affected)
- Performance issues causing user frustration
- Non-critical features unavailable
- Internal tools impacting productivity
- Data inconsistencies not affecting user experience

**Response Requirements:**
- On-call engineer response within 15 minutes
- Incident Commander assigned within 30 minutes
- Status page update within 30 minutes
- Stakeholder notification within 1 hour
- Regular team updates

**Communication Frequency:** Every 30 minutes during active response

#### SEV3 - Minor Impact
**Definition:** Limited impact with workarounds available

**Characteristics:**
- Single feature or component affected
- <25% of users impacted
- Workarounds available
- Performance degradation not significantly impacting UX
- Non-urgent monitoring alerts

**Response Requirements:**
- Response within 2 hours during business hours
- Next business day response acceptable outside hours
- Internal team notification
- Optional status page update

**Communication Frequency:** At key milestones only

#### SEV4 - Low Impact
**Definition:** Minimal impact, cosmetic issues, or planned maintenance

**Characteristics:**
- Cosmetic bugs
- Documentation issues
- Logging or monitoring gaps
- Performance issues with no user impact
- Development/test environment issues

**Response Requirements:**
- Response within 1-2 business days
- Standard ticket/issue tracking
- No special escalation required

**Communication Frequency:** Standard development cycle updates

### Incident Commander Role

#### Primary Responsibilities

1. **Command and Control**
   - Own the incident response process
   - Make critical decisions about resource allocation
   - Coordinate between technical teams and stakeholders
   - Maintain situational awareness across all response streams

2. **Communication Hub**
   - Provide regular updates to stakeholders
   - Manage external communications (status pages, customer notifications)
   - Facilitate effective communication between response teams
   - Shield responders from external distractions

3. **Process Management**
   - Ensure proper incident tracking and documentation
   - Drive toward resolution while maintaining quality
   - Coordinate handoffs between team members
   - Plan and execute rollback strategies if needed

4. **Post-Incident Leadership**
   - Ensure thorough post-incident reviews are conducted
   - Drive implementation of preventive measures
   - Share learnings with broader organization

#### Decision-Making Framework

**Emergency Decisions (SEV1/2):**
- Incident Commander has full authority
- Bias toward action over analysis
- Document decisions for later review
- Consult subject matter experts but don't get blocked
