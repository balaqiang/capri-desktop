## Risk Management Planning Workflow

Establish risk management process per ISO 14971.

### Workflow: Create Risk Management Plan

1. Define scope of risk management activities:
   - Medical device identification
   - Lifecycle stages covered
   - Applicable standards and regulations
2. Establish risk acceptability criteria:
   - Define probability categories (P1-P5)
   - Define severity categories (S1-S5)
   - Create risk matrix with acceptance thresholds
3. Assign responsibilities:
   - Risk management lead
   - Subject matter experts
   - Approval authorities
4. Define verification activities:
   - Methods for control verification
   - Acceptance criteria
5. Plan production and post-production activities:
   - Information sources
   - Review triggers
   - Update procedures
6. Obtain plan approval
7. Establish risk management file
8. **Validation:** Plan approved; acceptability criteria defined; responsibilities assigned; file established

### Risk Management Plan Content

| Section | Content | Evidence |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Scope | Device and lifecycle coverage | Scope statement |
| Criteria | Risk acceptability matrix | Risk matrix document |
| Responsibilities | Roles and authorities | RACI chart |
| Verification | Methods and acceptance | Verification plan |
| Production/Post-Production | Monitoring activities | Surveillance plan |

### Risk Acceptability Matrix (5x5)

| Probability \ Severity | Negligible | Minor | Serious | Critical | Catastrophic |
|------------------------|------------|-------|---------|----------|--------------|
| **Frequent (P5)** | Medium | High | High | Unacceptable | Unacceptable |
| **Probable (P4)** | Medium | Medium | High | High | Unacceptable |
| **Occasional (P3)** | Low | Medium | Medium | High | High |
| **Remote (P2)** | Low | Low | Medium | Medium | High |
| **Improbable (P1)** | Low | Low | Low | Medium | Medium |

### Risk Level Actions

| Level | Acceptable | Action Required |
|-------|------------|-----------------|
| Low | Yes | Document and accept; still reduce as far as possible (EU MDR) |
| Medium | After reduction AFAP | Reduce as far as possible; document why further reduction is impossible |
| High | After reduction AFAP | Reduction required; demonstrate all further options exhausted |
| Unacceptable | No | Design change mandatory |

> **EU MDR — AFAP, not ALARP:** For CE-marked devices, risks must be reduced **as far as possible (AFAP)** without economic considerations (MDR Annex I, GSPR 1–4; EN ISO 14971:2019/A11:2021 Z-annexes deviation). ALARP ("as low as reasonably practicable"), which permits cost-benefit weighing in acceptability decisions, is **not an acceptable criterion under the EU MDR** — a notified body will flag it. ISO 14971:2019 itself removed ALARP from the normative text. ALARP may persist in some non-EU jurisdictions (e.g., the UK HSE tradition); if used outside the EU, flag the deviation from EU requirements explicitly.

## Risk Analysis Workflow

Identify hazards and estimate risks systematically.

### Workflow: Conduct Risk Analysis

1. Define intended use and reasonably foreseeable misuse:
   - Medical indication
   - Patient population
   - User population
   - Use environment
2. Select analysis method(s):
   - FMEA for component/function analysis
   - FTA for system-level analysis
   - HAZOP for process deviations
   - Use Error Analysis for user interaction
3. Identify hazards by category:
   - Energy hazards (electrical, mechanical, thermal)
   - Biological hazards (bioburden, biocompatibility)
   - Chemical hazards (residues, leachables)
   - Operational hazards (software, use errors)
4. Determine hazardous situations:
   - Sequence of events
   - Foreseeable misuse scenarios
   - Single fault conditions
5. Estimate probability of harm (P1-P5)
6. Estimate severity of harm (S1-S5)
7. Document in hazard analysis worksheet
8. **Validation:** All hazard categories addressed; all hazards documented; probability and severity assigned

### Hazard Categories Checklist

| Category | Examples | Analyzed |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Electrical | Shock, burns, interference | ☐ |
| Mechanical | Crushing, cutting, entrapment | ☐ |
| Thermal | Burns, tissue damage | ☐ |
| Radiation | Ionizing, non-ionizing | ☐ |
| Biological | Infection, biocompatibility | ☐ |
| Chemical | Toxicity, irritation | ☐ |
| Software | Incorrect output, timing | ☐ |
| Use Error | Misuse, perception, cognition | ☐ |
| Environment | EMC, mechanical stress | ☐ |

### Analysis Method Selection

| Situation | Recommended Method |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Component failures | FMEA |
| System-level failure | FTA |
| Process deviations | HAZOP |
| User interaction | Use Error Analysis |
| Software behavior | Software FMEA |
| Early design phase | PHA |
