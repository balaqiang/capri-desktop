YOU ARE USING THE SKILL "spec-to-repo" FOR THIS ANSWER. It was written for someone with more tools than you: here you cannot run scripts or open files, so give the advice and the result yourself, in your own voice, and only as long as the job needs.

# Spec to Repo

Turn a natural-language project specification into a complete, runnable starter repository. Not a template filler — a spec interpreter that generates real, working code for any stack.

## When to Use

- User provides a text description of an app and wants code
- User has a PRD, requirements doc, or feature list and needs a codebase
- User says "build me an app that...", "scaffold this", "bootstrap a project"
- User wants a working starter repo, not just a file tree

**Not this skill** when the user wants a SaaS app with Stripe + Auth specifically — use `product-team/saas-scaffolder` instead.

## Core Workflow

### Phase 1 — Parse & Interpret

Read the spec. Extract these fields silently:

| Field | Source | Required |
|-------|--------|----------|
| App name | Explicit or infer from description | yes |
| Description | First sentence of spec | yes |
| Features | Bullet points or sentences describing behavior | yes |
| Tech stack | Explicit ("use FastAPI") or infer from context | yes |
| Auth | "login", "users", "accounts", "roles" | if mentioned |
| Database | "store", "save", "persist", "records", "schema" | if mentioned |
| API surface | "endpoint", "API", "REST", "GraphQL" | if mentioned |
| Deploy target | "Vercel", "Docker", "AWS", "Railway" | if mentioned |

**Stack inference rules** (when user doesn't specify):

| Signal | Inferred stack |
|--------|---------------|
| "web app", "dashboard", "SaaS" | Next.js + TypeScript |
| "API", "backend", "microservice" | FastAPI (Python) or Express (Node) |
| "mobile app" | Flutter or React Native |
| "CLI tool" | Go or Python |
| "data pipeline" | Python |
| "high performance", "systems" | Rust or Go |

After parsing, present a structured interpretation back to the user:

```
## Spec Interpretation

**App:** [name]
**Stack:** [framework + language]
**Features:**
1. [feature]
2. [feature]

**Database:** [yes/no — engine]
**Auth:** [yes/no — method]
**Deploy:** [target]

Does this match your intent? Any corrections before I generate?

Flag ambiguities. Ask **at most 3** clarifying questions. If the user says "just build it", proceed with best-guess defaults.

### Phase 2 — Architecture

Design the project before writing any files:

2. **Define file tree** — List every file that will be created
3. **Map features to files** — Each feature gets at minimum one file/component
4. **Design database schema** — If applicable, define tables/collections with fields and types
5. **Identify dependencies** — List every package with version constraints
6. **Plan API routes** — If applicable, list every endpoint with method, path, request/response shape

Present the file tree to the user before generating:

```
project-name/
├── README.md
├── .env.example
├── .gitignore
├── .github/workflows/ci.yml
├── package.json / requirements.txt / go.mod
├── src/
│   ├── ...
├── tests/
│   ├── ...
└── ...

### Phase 3 — Generate

Write every file. Rules:

- **Real code, not stubs.** Every function has a real implementation. No `// TODO: implement` or `pass` placeholders.
- **Syntactically valid.** Every file must parse without errors in its language.
- **Imports match dependencies.** Every import must correspond to a package in the manifest (package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod, etc.).
- **Types included.** TypeScript projects use types. Python projects use type hints. Go projects use typed structs.
- **Environment variables.** Generate `.env.example` with every required variable, commented with purpose.
- **CI config.** Generate `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with: install, lint (if linter in deps), test, build.
- **.gitignore.** Stack-appropriate ignores (node_modules, __pycache__, .env, build artifacts).

**File generation order:**
1. Manifest (package.json / requirements.txt / go.mod)
2. Config files (.env.example, .gitignore, CI)
3. Database schema / migrations
4. Core business logic
5. API routes / endpoints
6. UI components (if applicable)
7. Tests
8. README.md

### Phase 4 — Validate

After generation, run through this checklist:

- [ ] Every imported package exists in the manifest
- [ ] Every file referenced by an import exists in the tree
- [ ] `.env.example` lists every env var used in code
- [ ] `.gitignore` covers build artifacts and secrets
- [ ] README has setup instructions that actually work
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets, API keys, or passwords
- [ ] At least one test file exists
- [ ] Build/start command is documented and would work

## Examples

### Example 1: Task Management API

**Input spec:**
> "Build me a task management API. Users can create, list, update, and delete tasks. Tasks have a title, description, status (todo/in-progress/done), and due date. Use FastAPI with SQLite. Add basic auth with API keys."

**Output file tree:**
```
task-api/
├── README.md
├── .env.example              # API_KEY, DATABASE_URL
├── .gitignore
├── .github/workflows/ci.yml
├── requirements.txt          # fastapi, uvicorn, sqlalchemy, pytest
├── main.py                   # FastAPI app, CORS, lifespan
├── models.py                 # SQLAlchemy Task model
├── schemas.py                # Pydantic request/response schemas
├── database.py               # SQLite engine + session
├── auth.py                   # API key middleware
├── routers/
│   └── tasks.py              # CRUD endpoints
└── tests/
    └── test_tasks.py         # Smoke tests for each endpoint
