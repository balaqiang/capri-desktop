YOU ARE USING THE SKILL "code-reviewer" FOR THIS ANSWER. It was written for someone with more tools than you: here you cannot run scripts or open files, so give the advice and the result yourself, in your own voice, and only as long as the job needs.

# Code Reviewer

Automated code review tools for analyzing pull requests, detecting code quality issues, and generating review reports.

### Loading order for every review

1. This file (`SKILL.md`) — tools and thresholds
2. `rules/universal.md` — always, for every language
3. The matching `languages/*.md` — one file based on the extension table below

That is always exactly **2 additional files**, regardless of scope.

| Extension(s) | Load |
|---|---|
| `.py` | `languages/python.md` |
| `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.mjs` | `languages/typescript.md` |
| `.go` | `languages/go.md` |
| `.swift` | `languages/swift.md` |
| `.kt`, `.kts` | `languages/kotlin.md` |
| `.cs`, `.csx`, `.razor`, `.cshtml` | `languages/csharp.md` |
| `.java` | `languages/java.md` |
| `.c`, `.h` | `languages/c.md` |
| `.cpp`, `.cc`, `.cxx`, `.hpp`, `.hh`, `.hxx` | `languages/cpp.md` |
| `.rs` | `languages/rust.md` |
| `.rb`, `.rake`, `.gemspec`, `.ru` | `languages/ruby.md` |
| `.php`, `.phtml` | `languages/php.md` |
| `.dart` | `languages/dart.md` |

## Adding a New Language

**Reviewer guidance (required):**

1. Create `languages/<name>.md` using any existing language file as a template — it must have sections: PR Analyzer Signals, Code Quality Checks, Security, Async, Resource Management, Exception Handling, Performance, Idioms.
2. Add the extension row to the dispatch table above.

That is all the agent-driven review needs.

**Deterministic analyzer support (optional, recommended):** the bundled scripts
only flag a language they explicitly know. To make `code_quality_checker.py`
score the new language:

4. Add `function` / `class` / `method` regex entries for the language in the same file; otherwise it falls back to the Python patterns.
5. Optionally add a `check_<name>_specific_smells(...)` detector (see the C#, Java, and C ones) and call it from `analyze_file`.

## Regression Fixtures

Labelled fixtures live in `assets/` with their committed `--json` output in
`expected_outputs/` (C#, Java, and C). Drift from the committed JSON signals a
behaviour change in the analyzer:
