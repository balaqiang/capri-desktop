# Senior Project Management Expert

## Overview

Strategic project management for enterprise software, SaaS, and digital transformation initiatives. Provides portfolio management capabilities, quantitative analysis tools, and executive-level reporting frameworks for complex, multi-project portfolios.

### Core Expertise Areas

**Portfolio Management & Strategic Alignment**
- Multi-project portfolio optimization using advanced prioritization models (WSJF, RICE, ICE, MoSCoW)
- Strategic roadmap development aligned with business objectives and market conditions
- Resource capacity planning and allocation optimization across portfolio
- Portfolio health monitoring with multi-dimensional scoring frameworks

**Quantitative Risk Management**
- Expected Monetary Value (EMV) analysis for financial risk quantification
- Monte Carlo simulation for schedule risk modeling and confidence intervals
- Risk appetite framework implementation with enterprise-level thresholds
- Portfolio risk correlation analysis and diversification strategies

**Executive Communication & Governance**
- Board-ready executive reports with RAG status and strategic recommendations
- Stakeholder alignment through sophisticated RACI matrices and escalation paths
- Financial performance tracking with risk-adjusted ROI and NPV calculations
- Change management strategies for large-scale digital transformations

## Methodology & Frameworks

### Three-Tier Analysis Approach

**Tier 1: Portfolio Health Assessment**
Uses `project_health_dashboard.py` to provide comprehensive multi-dimensional scoring:

**Health Dimensions (Weighted Scoring):**
- **Timeline Performance** (25% weight): Schedule adherence, milestone achievement, critical path analysis
- **Budget Management** (25% weight): Spend variance, forecast accuracy, cost efficiency metrics
- **Scope Delivery** (20% weight): Feature completion rates, requirement satisfaction, change control
- **Quality Metrics** (20% weight): Code coverage, defect density, technical debt, security posture
- **Risk Exposure** (10% weight): Risk score, mitigation effectiveness, exposure trends

**RAG Status Calculation:**
- 🟢 Green: Composite score >80, all dimensions >60
- 🟡 Amber: Composite score 60-80, or any dimension 40-60
- 🔴 Red: Composite score <60, or any dimension <40

**Tier 2: Risk Matrix & Mitigation Strategy**
Leverages `risk_matrix_analyzer.py` for quantitative risk assessment:

**Risk Quantification Process:**
1. **Probability Assessment** (1-5 scale): Historical data, expert judgment, Monte Carlo inputs
2. **Impact Analysis** (1-5 scale): Financial, schedule, quality, and strategic impact vectors
3. **Category Weighting**: Technical (1.2x), Resource (1.1x), Financial (1.4x), Schedule (1.0x)
4. **EMV Calculation**:

**Risk Response Strategies (by score threshold):**
- **Avoid** (>18): Eliminate through scope/approach changes
- **Mitigate** (12-18): Reduce probability or impact through active intervention
- **Transfer** (8-12): Insurance, contracts, partnerships
- **Accept** (<8): Monitor with contingency planning

**Tier 3: Resource Capacity Optimization**
Employs `resource_capacity_planner.py` for portfolio resource analysis:

**Capacity Analysis Framework:**
- **Utilization Optimization**: Target 70-85% for sustainable productivity
- **Skill Matching**: Algorithm-based resource allocation to maximize efficiency
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Critical path resource constraints across portfolio
- **Scenario Planning**: What-if analysis for resource reallocation strategies

### Advanced Prioritization Models

Apply each model in the specific context where it provides the most signal:

**Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF)** — Resource-constrained agile portfolios with quantifiable cost-of-delay

**RICE** — Customer-facing initiatives where reach metrics are quantifiable

**ICE** — Rapid prioritization during brainstorming or when analysis time is limited

**Model Selection — Use this decision logic:**
```
if resource_constrained and agile_methodology and cost_of_delay_quantifiable:
    → WSJF
elif customer_facing and reach_metrics_available:
    → RICE
elif quick_prioritization_needed or ideation_phase:
    → ICE
elif multiple_stakeholder_groups_with_differing_priorities:
    → MoSCoW
elif complex_tradeoffs_across_incommensurable_criteria:
    → Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)

### Risk Management Framework

**Step 1: Risk Classification by Category**
- Technical: Architecture, integration, performance
- Resource: Availability, skills, retention
- Schedule: Dependencies, critical path, external factors
- Financial: Budget overruns, currency, economic factors
- Business: Market changes, competitive pressure, strategic shifts

**Step 2: Three-Point Estimation for Monte Carlo Inputs**

**Step 3: Portfolio Risk Correlation**

**Risk Appetite Framework:**
- **Conservative**: Risk scores 0-8, 25-30% contingency reserves
- **Moderate**: Risk scores 8-15, 15-20% contingency reserves
- **Aggressive**: Risk scores 15+, 10-15% contingency reserves

## Implementation Workflows

### Portfolio Health Review (Weekly)

1. **Data Collection & Validation**
   ⚠️ If any project composite score <60 or a critical data field is missing, STOP and resolve data integrity issues before proceeding.

2. **Risk Assessment Update**
   ⚠️ If any risk score >18 (Avoid threshold), STOP and initiate escalation to project sponsor before proceeding.

3. **Capacity Analysis**
   ⚠️ If any team utilization >90% or <60%, flag for immediate reallocation discussion before step 4.
