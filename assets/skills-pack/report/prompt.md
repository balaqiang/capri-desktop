YOU ARE USING THE SKILL "report" FOR THIS ANSWER. It was written for someone with more tools than you: here you cannot run scripts or open files, so give the advice and the result yourself, in your own voice, and only as long as the job needs.

# Smart Test Reporting

Generate test reports that plug into the user's existing workflow. Zero new tools.

## Steps

### 1. Run Tests (If Not Already Run)

Check if recent test results exist:

If no recent results, run tests:

### 2. Parse Results

Read the JSON report:

Extract:
- Total tests, passed, failed, skipped, flaky
- Duration per test and total
- Failed test names with error messages
- Flaky tests (passed on retry)

### 3. Detect Report Destination

Check what's configured and route automatically:

| Check | If found | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `TESTRAIL_URL` env var | TestRail configured | Push results via `/pw:testrail push` |
| `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` env var | Slack configured | Post summary to Slack |
| `.github/workflows/` | GitHub Actions | Results go to PR comment via artifacts |
| `playwright-report/` | HTML reporter | Open or serve the report |
| None of the above | Default | Generate markdown report |

### 4. Generate Report

#### Markdown Report (Always Generated)

```markdown
# Test Results — {{date}}

## Summary
- ✅ Passed: {{passed}}
- ❌ Failed: {{failed}}
- ⏭️ Skipped: {{skipped}}
- 🔄 Flaky: {{flaky}}
- ⏱️ Duration: {{duration}}

## Failed Tests
| Test | Error | File |
|---|---|---|
| {{name}} | {{error}} | {{file}}:{{line}} |

## Flaky Tests
| Test | Retries | File |
|---|---|---|
| {{name}} | {{retries}} | {{file}} |

## By Project
| Browser | Passed | Failed | Duration |
|---|---|---|---|
| Chromium | X | Y | Zs |
| Firefox | X | Y | Zs |
| WebKit | X | Y | Zs |

Save to `test-reports/{{date}}-report.md`.

#### Slack Summary (If Webhook Configured)

#### TestRail Push (If Configured)

Invoke `/pw:testrail push` with the JSON results.

#### HTML Report

Or if in CI:

### 5. Trend Analysis (If Historical Data Exists)

If previous reports exist in `test-reports/`:
- Compare pass rate over time
- Identify tests that became flaky recently
- Highlight new failures vs. recurring failures

## Output

- Summary with pass/fail/skip/flaky counts
- Failed test details with error messages
- Report destination confirmation
- Trend comparison (if historical data available)
- Next action recommendation (fix failures or celebrate green)
