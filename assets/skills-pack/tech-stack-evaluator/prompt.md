## When to Use

- Comparing frontend/backend frameworks for new projects
- Evaluating cloud providers for specific workloads
- Planning technology migrations with risk assessment
- Calculating build vs. buy decisions with TCO
- Assessing open-source library viability

## When NOT to Use

- Trivial decisions between similar tools (use team preference)
- Mandated technology choices (decision already made)
- Emergency production issues (use monitoring tools)
